# 📅 Welcome Call & Week 0: Program Kick-off & Tool Setup  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To get introduced to the program's scope and establish a strong, reproducible design environment for the upcoming RISC-V SoC Tapeout journey.  

---

## ✅ Key Highlights  
- Attended the **Welcome Call** to understand the program roadmap and expectations.  
- Successfully installed and configured the **open-source EDA toolchain**.  
- Cloned and verified the initial **reference project** to ensure the setup is ready.
