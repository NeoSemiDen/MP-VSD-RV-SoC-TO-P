# From Silicon to Sovereignty: RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program

This repository documents my journey through the **IIT Gandhinagar & VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, a 20-week national mission to turn India‚Äôs semiconductor vision into reality. My goal is to gain end-to-end chip design expertise, from RTL to physical tapeout, and contribute to this ambitious national effort.

## üöÄ The Mission

This program aligns with India's goal of **One Tapeout Per Student** and semiconductor self-reliance. It bridges the gap between academia and industry by providing hands-on, fabrication-focused learning with industry-grade tools and methodologies.

## üôè Essential Partners & Acknowledgments

This program is made possible by the visionary leadership and collaboration of several key organizations:

* **IIT Gandhinagar & VLSI System Design (VSD):** The organizers and driving force behind this initiative.
* **Synopsys:** A leading EDA provider, contributing industry-grade tools and methodologies.
* **Efabless:** The platform for open-source silicon, enabling the tapeout and fabrication flow.
* **SCL India:** The government-owned semiconductor fabrication facility, crucial for bringing the designs to silicon.
* **RISC-V International:** For promoting the open standard at the heart of the project.

A special thanks to **Kunal Ghosh**, co-founder of VSD, for his pivotal role in bridging the industry-academia gap.
