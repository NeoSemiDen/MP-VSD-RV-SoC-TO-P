## L1-L3 â€“ Lab4: Introduction to .lib 

We already discussed about the `.lib` files before. Here we will take a glimpse of it's contents.
- `.lib` file starts with the intoduction to technology.
- In our case it is `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025c_1v80`

Lets decode it: **`sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025c_1v80`**

- sky130 : Skywater 130nm process technology
- fd : foundary provided library
- sc : Standard cells library
- hd : High Density Librray

The later part gives the idea of **PVT**.

Process Voltage Temperature
- Process : tt : Typical Corner
- Voltage : 1v80 : 1.8 Volts Operating Voltage
- Temperature : 025c : 25 degrees Celcius.
