## Lessons

## L1-L3 â€“ Lab4: Introduction to .lib 

We already discussed about the `.lib` files before. Here we will take a glimpse of it's contents.
- `.lib` file starts with the intoduction to technology.
- In our case it is `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025c_1v80`

Lets decode it: **`sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025c_1v80`**

- sky130 : Skywater 130nm process technology
- fd : foundary provided library
- sc : Standard cells library
- hd : High Density Librray

The later part gives the idea of **PVT**.

Process Voltage Temperature (Operating Conditions)
- Process : tt : Typical Corner
- Voltage : 1v80 : 1.8 Volts Operating Voltage
- Temperature : 025c : 25 degrees Celcius.

We can also get idea of delay model used, units, delays tables, leakage power of the gates, etc.

Here we can see the snapshot of delay tables present in the .lib file.

### Different flavours of gates

- Here we can notice similar gate with different sizing, signifying, increased size and power, meanwhile the delay is reduced
