## Lessons

## L1-L2 â€“ Why Flops and Flop Coding Styles

Now, we have different elements in a circuit, and that includes clock too. This introduces sequential elements along with it.
- Flip-FLops are essential part of this.
- They are edge sensitive sequential element that can store bits, bytes and bits ofc.
- Along with their normal operation to store data at edge, they have set and reset functionality too.
- These functionalities can be synchronous or asynchronous or both.
- We will look at some such design.


#### Flip-FLop design with Synchronous Reset

````Verilog
module dff_syncres ( input clk , input async_reset , input sync_reset , input d , output reg q );
always @ (posedge clk )
begin
	if (sync_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
endmodule
````

- Here, we can notice that in the always block, in our sensitivity list, we have clock but no reset.
- Reset is inside the always block, making it a synchronous design.

#### Flip-FLop design with Asynchronous Reset

````Verilog
module dff_asyncres ( input clk ,  input async_reset , input d , output reg q );
always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset)
begin
	if(async_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
endmodule
````

- Here, our sensitivity list contains the reset making this design asynchronous to begin with.

#### Flip-FLop design with both

````Verilog
module dff_asyncres_syncres ( input clk , input async_reset , input sync_reset , input d , output reg q );
always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset)
begin
	if(async_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else if (sync_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
endmodule
````

- In this particular flop design, we demonstrated both async and sync reset.

#### Flip-FLop design with Asynchronous Set

````Verilog
module dff_async_set ( input clk ,  input async_set , input d , output reg q );
always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_set)
begin
	if(async_set)
		q <= 1'b1;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
endmodule
````

- In this design, rather than making the output zero at reset, we make output 1 at set signal high.

## L5-L6 â€“ Interesting Optimisations

Let's about some intresting optimisations in synthesis.

- For example: Multiplication with 2 in binary

````Verilog
module mul2 (input [2:0] a, output [3:0] y);
	assign y = a * 2;
endmodule
````

- In binary, multiplication with 2 means, shifting by 1 in left.
- Although if we try to compute it straigh forward, we will need a multiplier in general.
- But our synthesizer understands this shifting mechanism, the way it relates to binary multiplication with 2.

**This is how it get synthesized as:**

<p align="center">
  <img src="../W1_images/mult2_yosys.png" alt="mult2_yosys.png" width="600" style="border:2px solid black;"/>
  <br/>
  <em>Figure 9: Synthesized view of Our example - Multiplication with 2 </em>
</p>

---

- Another example - multiplication by 9 with 3 bit input and 6 bit output
````Verilog
module mult8 (input [2:0] a , output [5:0] y);
	assign y = a * 9;
endmodule
````
- In this case of binary multiplication, it can be seen as (a * 8) + (a * 1).
- This shows that I just need two copies of a, one with is shifted by 3 bits and one as it is.

  **This is how this one get synthesized**
  
<p align="center">
  <img src="../W1_images/mult8_yosys.png" alt="mult8_yosys.png" width="600" style="border:2px solid black;"/>
  <br/>
  <em>Figure 10: Synthesized view of Our example - Multiplication with 9 </em>
</p>


- 2 copies of a as we thought of.

This was it with some of the intresting optimisations. There will be more.
