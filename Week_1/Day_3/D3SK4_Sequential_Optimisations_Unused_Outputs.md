# ðŸ”¹ Day 3 â€“ Skill 4: Sequential Optimizations for Unused Outputs

---

## Lessons

## L1-L2 â€“ Sequential optimisation â€“ unused outputs



### Examples:

**Number 1** - counter_opt.v

````Verilog
module counter_opt (input clk , input reset , output q);
reg [2:0] count;
assign q = count[0];

always @(posedge clk ,posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		count <= 3'b000;
	else
		count <= count + 1;
end

endmodule
````
- Here, we have internal 3-bit counter, now from this counter, `bit 0` is assigned to the output q.
- In counter, `bit 0` toggles every cycles. `bit 1` and `bit 2` are unused in this design.
- So this seems like a flip-flop followed by a inverter connected back to flipflop's input.
- Unused outputs are avoided in synthesis.


Let's see what our synthesis tool do on this design.
- Being present in verilog_files folder as in previous labs, we will execute these commands.

````bash
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
read_verilog counter_opt.v 
synth -top counter_opt 
dfflibmap -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
show

**Number 2** - counter_opt2.v

````Verilog
module counter_opt2 (input clk , input reset , output q);
reg [2:0] count;
assign q = (count[2:0] == 3'b100);

always @(posedge clk ,posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		count <= 3'b000;
	else
		count <= count + 1;
end

endmodule
````

- Here, in this design, output q is 1 when the value on counter is `3'b100`.
- So we need all the bits of counter to compare against it.
- So, it becomes essential for counter logic to be synthesized as counter, unlike the last design when counter logic did not got synthesized as counter.
- So in this design, we have counter with all 3 bits used and compare logic to get output value.
