## L1 â€“ Introduction to optimisations (Part 1)

### Combinational Logic Optimisation

- Squeezing the logic to get the most optimised design
  - Area and Power Savings
- Constant Propagation
  - Direct Optimisation
- Boolean Logic Optimisation
  - K-map
  - Quine McKluskey
 
### Constant Propagation: Example

`Y = NOT ((A AND B) OR C)`

If `A = 0` then

`Y = NOT (( 0 ) OR C)`

`Y = NOT C`

- It is optimised when A never chnages and is always 0.

- From 2 gates, it turned out to be a single inverter.

### Boolean Logic Optimisation

- Another example : `y = a ? (b ? c:(c?a:0)) : (!c)`
- This says, if `a = 0` then `y = not c`
- If `a = 1` then go ahead and evaluate for b.
  - If `b = 1` then `y = c`.
  - If `b = 0` then go ahead and evaluate for c.
    - If `c = 0` then `y = 0`
    - If `c = 1` then `y = a`.

- In general, this will be seen as 3 multiplexers.
- But when simplified/optimised, the expresseion will come out to be ` y = a xnor b`.

### Sequential Logic Optimisations
- Basic
  - Sequential Constant propagation
- Advanced
  - State optimisation
  - Retiming
  - Sequential Logic Cloning (FLoorplan Aware Synthesis)
 
### Sequential Constant propagation

- In case of Sequential Circuits, constant propagation can relate to input being on constant, always on state of reset or changing state of set.
- For example:-
  - `DFF` connected with one input of `AND Gate`.
  - If the input to `DFF` is always 0 then, no matter what the output of the end gate will always be 0.
  - In that case, DFF is redundant, and can be optimised to just deliver 0 there.
  - Meanwhile, there can be one more situation, input of `DFF` is changing, but reset is always on.
  - In that case also, the output of `DFF` and `AND Gate` will remain zero.
  - Similar optimisation can be performed.

  - Another view, this time we have set signal, if my input to `DFF` is constant 0.
  - Still, we can't go ahead and optimise it. Because the application of set signal can make the output of `DFF` high.
  - And then it will again go to zero, in the next of removal of set signal.
 
  - So, such optimisation cannot be done just when input in constant, there are other signals too.
