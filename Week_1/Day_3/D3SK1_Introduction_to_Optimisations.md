# ðŸ”¹ Day 3 â€“ Skill 1: Introduction to Optimizations

## Lessons

## L1 â€“ Introduction to optimisations (Part 1)

### Combinational Logic Optimisation

- Squeezing the logic to get the most optimised design
  - Area and Power Savings
- Constant Propagation
  - Direct Optimisation
- Boolean Logic Optimisation
  - K-map
  - Quine McKluskey
 
### Constant Propagation: Example

`Y = NOT ((A AND B) OR C)`
If `A = 0` then
`Y = NOT (( 0 ) OR C)`
`Y = NOT C`

- It is optimised when A never chnages and is always 0.

- From 2 gates, it turned out to be a single inverter.
