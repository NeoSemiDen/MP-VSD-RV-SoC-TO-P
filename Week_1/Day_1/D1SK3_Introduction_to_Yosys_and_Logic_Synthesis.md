## Lessons

## L1 â€“ Introduction to Yosys

### Synthesizer
- Tool used for coverting the RTL to netlist
- **Yosys** is the synthesizer used in this Session.

### Yosys Setup
- Yosys takes Design and .lib as inputs and gives netlist as output.

- For reading the design - `read_verilog`
- For reading the .lib - `read_liberty`
- For writing  out the netlist - `write_verilog`

### Verify the Synthesis
- We need to verify the systhesis too, to check if we get the similar behaviour.
- We use the same set setup as before, and this time, instead of design we have Netlist as input.

## L2 â€“ Introduction to Logic Synthesis (Part 1)
### RTL Design
- Behavioral representation of the required specification

**IS THIS WHAT WE NEED?**
- No, we need Digital Logic Circuit.

**HOW?**

### Synthesis
