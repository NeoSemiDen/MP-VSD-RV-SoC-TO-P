## 📝 Notes
- **GLS** helps verify gate-level functionality after synthesis.  
- **Synthesis-Simulation mismatches** occur when RTL code behaves differently post-synthesis.  
- **Blocking (`=`) vs Non-blocking (`<=`) statements** affect simulation behavior and sequential logic design.  
- Labs reinforce proper coding patterns and highlight potential pitfalls in synthesis vs simulation.
