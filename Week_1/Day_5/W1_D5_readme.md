## 📝 Notes
- **IF-CASE constructs** optimize conditional logic for synthesis.  
- **Incomplete IF or overlapping CASE** can lead to unintended logic; labs help identify and correct these issues.  
- **For loop and for-generate** allow writing scalable, synthesis-friendly RTL code.  
- Hands-on labs reinforce coding patterns for efficient synthesis and area/timing optimization.
